2020-01-11,The Dawn Wall,2017,https://boxd.it/WdJ8R,4.5,,"It’s a shame this movie got overshadowed by Free Solo, because this movie is filled with wonderful things. I feel it’s more technical and revealing about the nature of the climbing world than Free Solo by miles. Both are great movies but I think this one edges out the victory on “most entertaining”",,2020-01-10
2020-01-11,Casting JonBenet,2017,https://boxd.it/WemKv,3.5,,"Definitely an interesting concept for a “documentary” if you can call it that. There are some extremely memorable moments (those kids smashing the watermelons had me yelling at the tv) but there aren’t many facts. Just lots of (often crazy) opinions about what could have happened. If it was any longer than it was, I would’ve gotten bored.",,2020-01-10
2020-01-26,Midsommar,2019,https://boxd.it/XEPiB,4.5,,"I used to keep a list of things I wish I could see more of in horror movies. I feel like Ari Aster hacked my computer and found that list because this hit a lot of those points. There were several times during the movie where my breathing pattern was <i>far</i> from normal in ways that other movies could only dream of accomplishing. I wish more writers and directors took the time to build characters and construct construct storylines that make the audience pause and ask “why do I relate to this?” even when, in all reality, you probably should NOT relate. 


On another note, Florence Pugh’s performance is worthy of all the awards and I hope she does amazing things in 2020 and beyond.",,2020-01-25
2020-02-21,The Evil Dead,1981,https://boxd.it/ZWMuj,3.5,,"I think about this movie a lot. It would be incorrect to say I “enjoy” this film, but there are some real moments of brilliance that I can’t get out of my head. I always have a hell of a time watching The Evil Dead.",,2020-02-20
2020-02-24,Parasite,2019,https://boxd.it/10fsj9,5,,"I really enjoyed this. Like, really REALLY. I’m impressed by my experience with it for two reasons. For one, I’m incredibly impressed by the lack of spoilers I’ve come across in the real world since the hype for this movie really ramped up. I love going into a movie and not knowing anything about it. Thanks to all of social media for that, I guess. And two, it’s one of the first movies in a long time that actually lived up to the hype. I’m often disappointed by movies that people won’t shut the f*** up about. But this was not the case here at all! Good God, I could watch this movie several more times and enjoy every second of each viewing. That’s not a common feeling for me, trust me.",,2020-02-23

2020-08-23,The Little Shop of Horrors,1960,https://boxd.it/1jyVYf,2.5,,"I remember seeing the Jack Nicholson dentist scene as a child. Maybe that’s partly where my strong aversion to anything teeth related in recent horror movies comes from. The plot for this movie has so much potential but, as basically anyone with a pulse will notice, the acting is so bad. I did laugh out loud once or twice, so I guess I was entertained.",,2020-08-22
2020-09-09,Southbound,2015,https://boxd.it/1lrsRN,4,,I’ve been recommended this movie by friends and streaming platform algorithms for a while now. I’m glad I finally got around to watching it. There are some real highlights to this movie and I’m dying to know more about the individual stories told here. I’m really starting to think anthologies are my kind of thing.,,2020-09-08
2020-09-09,The Lodge,2019,https://boxd.it/1lrxNh,2.5,,"There’s a lot of potential in this movie: processing trauma, religion, cults, isolation in a lodge in the middle of nowhere, a child who is obsessed with dolls. But uhhhhhhhhhhh this film does NOTHING with it. This movie relies on too many horror movie tropes without actually drawing them out with any real story telling. 

So many of the reviews say this reminded them of <i>Hereditary</i> or <i>The Shining. </i>I think it’s really just the heavy reliance on symbolism in <i>The Lodge </i>that reminds us how good the storytelling was in those movies. But this is not that. This was a movie filled with nostalgic themes stitched together with bad character development and, honestly, some pretty strange choices in camera work. I rarely notice explicit choices in camera angles unless they’re really good or <i>really</i> <i>really </i>bad. Guess which category this one falls into!",,2020-09-06
2020-12-20,Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,2020,https://boxd.it/1wo5Qv,3,,"The acting was superb, obviously. The story and dialogue was superb, (also) obviously. This just doesn’t sit with me as something I will revisit. The directing felt lazy, honestly. There was so much potential, but it fell flat",,2020-12-19
2020-12-26,Soul,2020,https://boxd.it/1xdfrH,4.5,,"This is the most elaborate setup for a dunk on the Knicks I’ve seen in my life, and I loved every second of it. The amount of work that went into this movie is astounding. I can’t remember the last time I laughed so hard while also feeling a deep connection with a movie. What a fun time, sincerely.",,2020-12-25
2020-12-27,Sound of Metal,2019,https://boxd.it/1xpMjZ,4.5,,"I can’t believe my family let me choose this as the movie to watch the day after Christmas. We were all riding such a high after watching <i>Soul</i> yesterday. 

Ok but really, this movie has wonderful pacing and character building. I was engrossed in the characters’ lives from beginning to end. I’m excited to see where Riz Ahmed’s and Olivia Cooke’s careers go next because they were outstanding. 

Also, as a side note, my dad falls asleep during almost every movie — and he didn’t fall asleep during this one. So that must mean something.",,2020-12-26
2021-02-06,Crawl,2019,https://boxd.it/1DPq6Z,3.5,,"I grew up watching those sci-fi channel monster movies (Shark Attack 3: Megalodon is a 10/10 in my book). This is not that. And I love it all the more for that. Surprisingly good acting and a fun take on a monster movie. 

As a side note, I’m from Florida. This is not the worst portrayal of Florida I’ve ever seen. Hurricane parties are a thing, <i>and they’re pretty great. </i>",,2021-02-05
2021-02-12,The Wailing,2016,https://boxd.it/1EEYeP,4,,"It took me way too long to watch this movie. I read too many reviews like “blah blah blah this movie is too long”. Give me 10 hours of this kind of movie, and I will watch it all. Happily. 

There’s something so visceral and engaging about this movie. I really wish I had the correct words to string together a review that fully respects the hard work of Hong Kyung-pyo. Anything he touches is gold.",,2021-02-11
2021-03-06,Nomadland,2020,https://boxd.it/1HK7bx,4.5,,"I had such an emotional response to this movie. I know it was the personal connection I felt to the happy moments of this film, and it was the moments that reminded me of my grandparents.

The highs in this movie are short but full. I wish there were more of them, but I understand the choice in keeping those moments brief. That being said this movie made me want to fly out to California in the midst of a pandemic just to feel that fine mist that can only come from waves of salt water hitting the shore. 

Then there’s the rest of the movie",,2021-03-05
2021-03-12,There Will Be Blood,2007,https://boxd.it/1Ixazv,4,,"This movie has been on my watchlist for an incredibly long time. What a masterclass in acting and character development. The final act is one of the best I’ve seen in a long time. There’s a reason this movie is talked about so highly, and I feel like a fool for not watching it sooner.",,2021-03-11
2021-03-16,The Handmaiden,2016,https://boxd.it/1J6LTH,4,,"“I’m sorry...WHAT” - me out loud to myself several times during this movie. 

Everything about The Handmaiden is well-crafted and unique. The acting, pacing, cinematography, and costume/set designs are all so purposeful. It has the same air about it that other big Korean thrillers do, but it still is so...different. I have never seen a movie so extremely horny and also viscerally not horny at the same time. It’s definitely something you watch alone and then afterwards try to word your Letterboxd review in such a way that you don’t come off as a total freak. 

My final notes about this movie are:
-DO NOT WATCH THIS WITH YOUR PARENTS
-One of the final lines in this movie is *chef’s kiss*",,2021-03-15
2021-03-21,Minari,2020,https://boxd.it/1JKzzb,4.5,,I loved this movie. Like truly. I wish I could bottle up the feelings I got during the grandma-grandson interactions and keep them forever. Every single actor deserves all the awards. The score was so beautiful and moving. I’m not sure what else to say.,,2021-03-20
2021-04-12,Burning,2018,https://boxd.it/1MW7CR,5,Yes,"I normally hate rewatching films within a short span of time, but this deserved it 100%

The color palette used in this movie is so beautiful and calming. The most stressful scenes are steeped in awfully comforting tones of blue and yellow. An absolute masterclass in building an easy/uneasy balance in the back of your mind. 

The dialogue is so thoughtfully written that it reminds of the first, second, and third time I watched <i>The Sixth Sense</i>. I like to think I’m not so easily duped but this plot absolutely floors me. An elegant slow burn with a wonderful twist that hasn’t been ruined by some random asshole. 

The characters are incredibly intriguing. Their lives fit together like puzzle pieces that I found way too relatable. Jong-su and Hae-mi represent all of the uneasiness of figuring someone else out for the first time. I just can’t get enough of all of them, including Ben. 

I am tagging this as having spoilers because I wanted to (1) preserve the sanctity of this movie’s brilliance and (2) publicly document my unabashed personal preference that I would, without a doubt, be okay with being murdered by Steve Yeun in this circumstance. <b>Please</b> let me go out this way.","topstats, top2018",2021-04-11

2021-05-01,I Saw the Devil,2010,https://boxd.it/1PC21t,3.5,,"“Revenge is for movies”

A very good revenge film with quite a lot going for it. When people say this movie is brutal, they are not lying. There are some truly unique moments that rival the most visceral body horror I’ve seen in a long time. Tae-joo was a very interesting minor character that gave me flashbacks to the first time I watched <i>House of 1000 Corpses. </i>

The camerawork and combat scenes remind me of a lot of American action movies that I just cannot get into. Otherwise, it was an interesting take on the revenge trope.",,2021-04-30
2021-05-18,Saw,2004,https://boxd.it/1RVvQ7,4,Yes,"This movie still holds up. I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was in middle school and being blown away by the ending. It’s still a pretty great storyline, and you can see why it spawned one of the most successful horror movie franchises ever. Jigsaw’s motivation is meant to be extremely simple, but he makes for a unique antagonist nonetheless. The moral dilemmas that are set up in this first movie are relatively shallow, but they’re still developed enough to deliver severe agita to the casual viewer. 

The first <i>Saw </i>is a far cry from the “torture porn” that the sequels definitely strive for. I was honestly a bit surprised by the lack of gore in this, compared to what my brain remembers. Don’t get me wrong, <i>Saw</i> is still an incredibly grimy low budget movie. But it fucking rocks, too.",,2021-05-17
2021-05-21,Saw II,2005,https://boxd.it/1Si4GP,3,Yes,"The story is surprisingly good, but the editing is so overly done it’s hard to pay attention. The editing needs to chill out. This might sound basic, but I appreciate that the traps designed for specific people were not necessarily attempted by those people. Without that detail, this would have been an incredibly formulaic torture movie.",,2021-05-20

2021-05-29,A Quiet Place Part II,2020,https://boxd.it/1ThUxd,4,,"I’m a slut for any movie that reveals more about the Day 1 “how shit started to go down” timeline. That and Cillian Murphy. 

This really pays homage to the best moments of the first movie. I saw this in theaters (the first time back in over a year!) and the audience seemed to eat those callbacks up. There was a moment in the opening sequence when the lady sitting behind me whispered “oh NO” and she was so right. Oh NO. 

Anyway, I don’t know what else I could’ve asked from this movie. Maybe a little more time spent on the ending? Maybe less shots of people’s bare feet?",,2021-05-28
2021-06-07,The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It,2021,https://boxd.it/1UDyfJ,3,,"All of these movies are the same. They have such great set up (and I would say this movie has the best set up of the The Conjuring trilogy), but they fumble the bag so hard in the final act it’s unbelievable. It’s like everyone involved with the movie gets tired of it halfway through. Ugh. 

My biggest gripe in this movie (and franchise): There’s always a scene with a lot of wind and dust being whipped around during the climax of these movies. Like all the characters are yelling and someone is crying and the camera angles go crazy. Yeah. Enough of that. 

I appreciate the deeper dive into the occult, although the “satanists are evil” thing is a little dated. But whatever. I don’t think satanists are going to be too hurt about this one. I do wish they pushed the lore a bit harder and just really show some fucked up stuff. It’s already rated R even though it mostly feels like a PG-13 movie, so you might as well commit to it. 

Anyway, Vera Farmiga shines in everything she’s in. Patrick Wilson was great, too. Whoever did the casting for Arne’s character needs to do the casting for my biopic in the future. Y’all had him looking like the Tumblr White boy of the Month, when the real dude looks like a guy who hangs out alone at Chuck E Cheese in his spare time. Bravo.",,2021-06-06
2021-06-08,Bo Burnham: Inside,2021,https://boxd.it/1UL6xB,3.5,,"I struggle to rate this. I will not be watching this again anytime soon, but to say I wasn’t entertained the whole time would be a lie. Nobody else is allowed to write anymore content about 2020. Maybe my feelings about that will change in the distant future but as of now, Bo Burnham is the only one who could do it remotely any justice. He’s definitely a creative guy with a lot to offer, and his perspective on things is always interesting to listen to. Anyway, I’m just kind of sad now. 

Also that pirate map joke was pretty funny.",,2021-06-07
2021-06-09,Memories of Murder,2003,https://boxd.it/1UTePf,4,,"This movie took some time before it drew me in. Though, once it did, I really enjoyed the story. I was surprised by the level of humor in some parts, too. Never would’ve guessed I’d actually laugh during this movie after reading the description. I was originally going to rate this 3 1/2 stars, but I bumped it up by 1/2 star for the cinematography and the dropkicks.",,2021-06-08

2021-06-18,Dogtooth,2009,https://boxd.it/1VZcen,3.5,,"<i>Dogtooth</i> is only my second Yorgos movie but I think I figured out his style. Aesthetically, the movies are beautifully simple. The dialogue is unnervingly simple. You crave to know more about the characters. And then there’s a scene or two that makes you want to crawl out of your own skin. I can dig it.",,2021-06-17
2021-06-21,Saint Maud,2019,https://boxd.it/1WoUE5,2.5,,"I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone. This is the shortest movie I’ve watched in a while and still felt way too long. The good things about this movie can be found in so many other movies. The bad things about it aren’t unique either. It’s a promising plot with ok acting, shallow character development, and off-putting visual effects. There’s some really fun shots strewn about this movie that <i>almost</i> make you go “oh hey this is the artistic direction A24 films try to emulate”, but otherwise I think this is a low point for them, as far as “horror” goes.",,2021-06-20
2021-07-08,State of Play,2009,https://boxd.it/1YF7TR,3,,"The casting list is DEEP. Every few minutes, my mom would yell “______ is in this movie too???”. The only other notable thing about this movie was how bad the dialogue was. Like laugh out loud bad. Anyway, this is an easily digestible political drama without a whole lot else going on. An alright choice for a family who can never agree on a movie to watch.",,2021-07-07
2021-07-15,The Strange Thing About the Johnsons,2011,https://boxd.it/1ZGInz,3.5,,"The opening sequence might be the pinnacle of Ari Aster’s career. It’s amazing that this was less than 30 minutes long, because I feel like I just aged 30 years.",,2021-07-14
2021-07-16,A Classic Horror Story,2021,https://boxd.it/1ZRsyj,2.5,,"This was fine. Better than I expected, but not by much. A little heavy handed on the male gaze. This was clearly written by a bunch of guys who don’t talk to women enough. That kind of thing is common in horror, but for some reason this rubbed me the wrong way. Even at the moment we are supposed to be like “oooooo yeah! Get him! Feel empowered, bestie!”, everything feels uninspired and cheap. That’s how shallow the female characters are in this. I guess the counter argument to that would be : all of the characters are that shallow. But blegh. Something is just off. 

The comparisons to other horror movies mentioned in other reviews are fair points. But I think the plot is <i>just barely</i> different enough that I don’t understand the complaints. It’s not incredibly original, but it’s not an exact ripoff. 

Anyway, Matilda Lutz is hot and looks great holding a shot gun.",,2021-07-15
2021-07-26,Possessor,2020,https://boxd.it/21p2G9,4,,"Cool concept. Slow pacing with some intense scenes of violence. Maybe a little too short and too many strobe effects. Otherwise, a very slick movie.",,2021-07-25
2021-07-28,Let the Right One In,2008,https://boxd.it/21GniB,4,Yes,"This movie has aged like a fine wine.

2021-07-30,Saw VI,2009,https://boxd.it/21WVyb,3,Yes,"The story really starts to go off the rails between V and VI… this one feels a lot like a filler episode to explain things, just in case you’re too stupid to follow the plot.",,2021-07-29

2021-08-02,Ju-on: The Grudge,2002,https://boxd.it/22pLFT,4.5,Yes,"The original may not have the bells and whistles of the remake, but I still think it packs a punch. 

The first time I saw this, I had to sneak it because my mom didn’t want me watching scary movies. The tv I watched it on wasn’t setup correctly so the subtitles were cutoff at the bottom half the time. And I still had the piss scared out of me. To this day, I can’t walk past the bottom of a staircase in the dark without my heart rate increasing. My brain will refuse to let me look at the landing at the top of the stairs. 

The small details and thrilling cinematic shots are a joy (and thrill) to see. It’s all sooooo early 2000’s, but you can see why this became a classic when many others did not.

I think this movie pushes past that simple narrative in some magical ways. But it’s got some great scary moments, for sure. 

The fantasy elements are woven throughout such a rough landscape, it’s hard not to find solace in them.

It really sets the scene for this no-frills classic. It’s understandable why almost every trope, scene, and character has been copied to death by horror directors since.

2021-10-03,Titane,2021,https://boxd.it/2b6pK1,4,,"An insane exploration into gender, intimate relationships, and the limits of the human body. 

Firmly planted in the body horror genre, <i>Titane</i> holds nothing back. Beautifully shot, with a crazy good performance from Agatha Rouselle, this movie is definitely captivating. Before the plot is even fully revealed, I was floored by Alexia’s whole <i>thing</i>. I could have had a whole movie just based on the first 30ish minutes. That being said, when this movie switched gears (ha), I was still all on board. 

Without spoiling anything specific, I will say that the crux of the body horror plot line is my worst nightmare. Absolutely terrifying and uncomfortable to watch all the way to the end.

It sucked that the best of the segments was first, since it really set expectations high. 

 “The Empty Wake” was a little slow, but it went from 0 to 100 real quick. I’ll give it that. Kind of a classic jump scare setup, but it was fun!

“The Subject” was fucking WILD. Imagine if the guy from Human Centipede got a degree in robotics engineering and really loved Gears of War. This one surprisingly dragged the most. It felt like it was never going to end. 

“Terror” was another incredibly wild concept, but started off feeling almost too real. It goes off the tracks in such an incredible way though. Good shit. I thought it was a nice final segment.

But if you’ve got an attention span and you want to enjoy the best Korean cinema has to offer, strap in. You know that feeling you get when you’re watching a scary movie and there’s that one moment where you think “oh shit ok here we go! It’s kicking off now!”
Imagine that for 2 hours.
